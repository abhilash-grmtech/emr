Review 1st OCtober:

1. Submit button
2. When i exit without hitting submit the view layer should show in orange color so I know data is unsaved state.
3. Unsaved data in view layer will have "edit/save/reset" like name
4. When I type "phq9 edit" in search it does not work
5. DB save
6. Greaph on left.
