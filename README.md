Todo:

   1. images come below other content
   2. layer1-rhs comes over the complete popup
2. For the unlocked note the amendment icon will behave differently. Invoke reminder command if I click on the amendment icon
3. Content assist @vikas
4. Dont show prev and next if it is the first or last note.
5. Slider value does not change when prev and next inside note is clicked
6. On some prev and next multiple icons on the timeline are becoming green
7. On page load in the appt slider the unlocked note should be active.
